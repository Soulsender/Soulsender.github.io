Hiya! My name is Soul, I'm a student, hacker, gamer, music producer, video editor, and cyberpunk enthusist :)

I have a couple different certifcations, my most proud one being the CCNA.

Turns out I know what I am doing *sometimes* :3

Be sure to check out my blog below for detailed writeups, or my [github](https://github.com/soulsender) for source code and project material!
