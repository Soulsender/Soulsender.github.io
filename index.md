### /home/soulsender
Hiya! My name is Soul, I'm a student, hacker, gamer, music producer, video editor, 3d modeller and cyberpunk enthusist :)

I have a couple different certifications, my most proud one being the CCNA.

I am constantly trying to improve myself, and learn as much as I can. My [notes](https://notes.soulsender.me) are a good informal reflection of my progress

Be sure to check out my blog below for some detailed writeups, or my [github](https://github.com/soulsender) for source code and project material!

I may have referred you to this website for career reasons. If that is the case, and you wish to verify my identity, send me an email to my real name, with the domain `@soulsender.me` and I'll do my best to respond. I will recieve any email to this domain, even if the address is incorrect.
