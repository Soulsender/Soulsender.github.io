### A Quick Overview Of How I Represent This Information
This blog post aims to inform people of the Project 2025 plan of the Heritige Foundation. I am not attempting to alter your opinion, I aim to provide facts based on my own research I have done to the best of my ability using sources I have vetted to the best of my ability.

I myself am bisexual, in an active gay relationship, and a member of the hacker community which is largely queer. You can probably guess my personal opinion on the subject of the project. 

I am also Canadian, and you can probably guess how I felt when my country and my people were disrespected and disregarded as "America's 51st state," despite our sovereignty and independance from the USA.

Dispite this, and my own personal beliefs, I believe in true free speech, and it is my duty as a hacker to promote this.

### What is Project 2025
**[If you wish to read the original plan, you can download it here.](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf)**

Project 2025 is the goal of the Heritage Foundation, a group that aims to drastically change America from what it is, and claims to be.

Project 2025 directly claims to be "the work of the entire conservative movement."

> **From the Project 2025 Wikipedia Page:** "Project 2025 is the ninth iteration of the Mandate for Leadership series, published since 1981. The project asserts a controversial interpretation of the unitary executive theory, according to which the entire executive branch is under the complete control of the U.S. president. It proposes reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service workers as political appointees in order to replace them with people loyal to the president." [1]

It aims to take control of branches of the US government, including the Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Commerce (DOC), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

It aims to abolish both the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Education (ED). 

It explitly rejects abortion and critical medical care, as well as promotes anti-queer, anti-gender equality, and more as being "anti 1st ammendment":

> **Direct from the Project 2025 Playbook:**
>"The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors. This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (“SOGI”), diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists" [2]

**I highly urge you to directly read the Foreword of the Project 2025 Mandate, as it contains more examples of such ideas.**

### Will Donald Trump Implement Project 2025?
It is more than likely based on his party, his MAGA ideals, and his choices for multiple governmental positions.

JD Vance, the soon-to-be vice president, aligns with many of the things I've talked about above; and "served on the board of advisors of American Moment, a networking and training organization for young conservatives that is affiliated with Project 2025." [3]

Vance also has "support for gun rights, opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage, and American military aid to Ukraine. Vance is an outspoken critic of childlessness and has acknowledged Catholic theology's influence on his sociopolitical positions." [4]

> "[Russell Vought] is involved with Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation-led plan that seeks to reshape the federal government. Vought was named policy director of the Republican National Committee platform committee in May 2024.
In November 2024, president-elect Trump announced that he would renominate Vought as director of the OMB for his second term as president." [5]

> "[Tom] Homan joined the Heritage Foundation in February 2022 and became a contributor to its Project 2025. In November 2024, Trump announced that Homan will serve as "border czar" during his second presidency." [6]

> "Brendan Carr authored a chapter in Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise, the blueprint document of Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which outlines proposed policies for a future Donald Trump administration." and "November 2024, Trump selected Carr to lead the FCC, succeeding Jessica Rosenworcel." [7]
