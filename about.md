### /about

Hiya! My name is Soul, I'm a student, hacker, gamer, music producer, video editor, 3d modeller and cyberpunk enthusist :)

I have a couple different certifications, my most proud one being the CCNA.

I am constantly trying to improve myself, and learn as much as I can. My [notes](https://notes.soulsender.me) are a good informal reflection of my progress

Be sure to check out my blog for some detailed writeups, or my [github](https://github.com/soulsender) for source code and project material!

### /about/linux
I love to see the inner workings of computers, and I use Linux operating systems on a daily basis. I am comfortable in the terminal, being able to edit firewall permissions, create VPN servers, remotely SSH into said servers, and manage desktop enviroments.

### /about/hacking
Along with my ever-growing knowledge of Linux operating systems, I compete in Capture the Flag (CTFs) hacking competitions, where hackers compete to breach and steal a flag from a machine. CTFs can be divided into different types of hacks, such as web, cryptography, forensics, reverse engineering, and even more!

### /about/programming
I make programming projects such as automated bots, and applications. I've learned to use API documentation for things like Discord, as well as have done some rudimentary website development. I am also able to write bash scripts for automating shell activity.

### /about/identity
I may have referred you to this website for career reasons. If that is the case, and you wish to verify my identity, send me an email to my real name, with the domain `@soulsender.me` and I'll do my best to respond.
